The purpose of the project is to solve a classification problem. Does a patient have diabetes based on the input variables?

# Exploratory Data Analysis
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis to see distributions of the features and scatter plots of features sets.

# Algorithms
- Ran Logistic, Random Forest and Decision tree algorithms on the data to develop a model. 
- Tuned the predictive model to reach a 79 percent accuracy on the test dataset.

# Summary
Ran various models to see its accuracy and found random forest algorithm to be the best performer. Some additional insights include finding out the most important features that affect a positive diagnosis of diabetes which in this case it was Glucose and BMI feature.
